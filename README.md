Cascade Skills Assessment

Built using Javascript, CSS, Node, Nest, and React.

Although my experience and preferences would have typically built a project is this scale with Express, for a Fin-Tech company it would be my reccomendation to use something like Nest for an efficient and scalable web applications, and its clean and modularized architecture pattern makes it easier to build more scalable and easily maintainable applications. Specifically it would be used over something like Express to handle the complex business logic, and it's written in TypeScript, which ensures that the application is reliable and bug-free. Additionally, Nest has built-in features such as middleware and error handling, which can make it easier to build a secure and reliable application. Thus I chose Nest for this to further exemplify my understand of the problems you may currently face as a company, rather than the easiest solution for this problem.
