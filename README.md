Cascade Skills Assessment

Built using Javascript, CSS, Node, and React.

Disclaimer, had less time than I would have liked as I am flying accross the continent tomorrow and had to tie up a lot of lose ends, but I figured I would submit what I have. 

It still functions perfectly fine, however I admit the files could have easily been seperated into smaller components. 

For a project like this, I would typically use Express due to the simplistic nature, however the use of Nest would be more appropriate for anything related to fintech. Would have loved to do more, but I figured this should at least show you some fullstack work. 


If you want to run the container locally:

docker build -t cascadeasses:latest .
docker run -p 8080:443 cascadeasses:latest

However I have already uploaded it to a CICD pipeline on the google cloud from the docker file if you would prefer to access it there:

I will be back to work monday April 21st if you would like to see more or get ahold of me.

Cheers,
Bran
